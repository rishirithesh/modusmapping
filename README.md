This was our submission for the Cyber Hackathon conducted by the District Police Department of Thoothukudi, TamilNadu. We were given a set of 6 problem statements : 

1. Smart Traffic Management System
2. Park Smart : Real-Time Parking Availability Solution
3. EmpowerHer : A Safety App for Womenâ€™s Secure Travel
4. CrimeSpot : Targeting Hotspots for Smarter Policing
5. ModusMapping: Mapping crimes and criminals
through their Modus Operandi
6. CopBotChatbox: Chatbox to bridge the gap
between citizens and Police.

Suggested by our institute mentors and proffesors, We chose the 5th problem statement - ModusMapping
Our initial idea was to create a sample dataset of ours with huge amount of data in it, I gave a scratch idea of how I want the U.I and Frontend to look, Sanjay S took over the frontend coding using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Rohit and Myself took care of the backend logic, coding, libraries, plugins and more.
With high end libraries like - Polars, Feathers, Matplotlib, Flask - We drafted our project.
